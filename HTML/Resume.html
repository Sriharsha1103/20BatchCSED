        <h2>Career Objective</h2>
        <p>
            It is a long <b>established</b> fact that a <strong>reader</strong> will be distracted by the <i>readable</i> content 
            of a <em>page</em> when looking at 
        its layout. The point of using <small>Lorem</small> <del>Ipsum</del> is that it has a <mark>more-or-less</mark> normal distribution of letters, as opposed 
        to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and 
        web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many 
        web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes 
        on purpose (injected humour and the like).
